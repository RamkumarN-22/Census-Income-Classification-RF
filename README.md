# ðŸ§  Census Income Prediction using Random Forest

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

This project analyzes census income data to predict whether an individual's **annual income exceeds $50K** based on demographic and employment-related features. The model is built using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

| native-country     | Country of origin                       |
| Annual-Income      | Target variable (`>50K` or `<=50K`)     |

## ðŸ§¹ Preprocessing Steps

- Replaced `?` placeholders with `NaN`
- Imputed missing values using **mode**
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Renamed the target column to `Annual_Income`
- Performed outlier and correlation checks
- Split data into train (80%) and test (20%)

## ðŸ¤– Model Used

> **RandomForestClassifier** from `sklearn.ensemble`

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
